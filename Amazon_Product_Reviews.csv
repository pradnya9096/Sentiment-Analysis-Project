0,4 May 2019,"Platina on, Garmi gone! Efficient cooler for normal sized room | Review | Tips",4.0,"Summer and air cooler goes synonymously. As temperatures went above bearing limit, there was need for cooler. My earlier cooler went bad last season only, so was waiting for another summer.On one of my friend‚Äôs recommendations I selected it along with few other models from other manufacturers like symphony, Crompton etc.Upon subsequent analysis wrt price point, features and utility, Bajaj platinic emerged on top, from among similar range products from other companies. Budget may be one of the strong factors governing your inclination.‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢INSIDE BOX‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚ñ∂ Cooler‚ñ∂ Manual‚ñ∂ Warranty Card‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢PROS‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢1. Good looking, lightweight & portable.2. Good quality construction.3. Effective cooling for room size of 10x15ft.4. Honeycomb type cooling pads on three sides for effective cooling.5. Castor wheels (4nos) for easy relocation.6. Noise levels are in acceptable range.7. Good capacity water tank. Single fill lasts for full 12 hours continuous usage.8. Auto swing ensures uniform cooling of room, from right to left.9. Full plastic body means no issue like in all metal desert coolers, which rust after a while and start leaking at times.10. Easy mechanical water level indicator to let you know when tank is empty.11. Sufficiently long cable, approx. 1.5 metre. For more you require extension cord.‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢CONS‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢1. Installed honeycomb type pads are difficult to find. You need to settle for normal grass pads later on when these are clogged.2. Only 1 year warranty from here, while there‚Äôs 2 year warranty from online Bajaj store. But it‚Äôs slightly costly over there.3. Description shows four way air deflection but in actual vertical blades can be adjusted manually (all blades move simultaneously), while all horizontal blades move at once via auto swing motor.4. Locking knobs for side and back panels, are rough in operation.5. Manual details two models and confuses user without addressing specific variant.6. Water inlet is small if you intend to fill it mug by mug. Rest you can use pipe for one shot filling or remove panel to fill it directly by small bucket.For the cons, I am deducting 1 star. 4 STARS as the product fulfils its purpose in best possible way with some scope for improvement in other domains...‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢KNOB CONTROLS‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢Knob 1: Four positions- on/off cooler & control fan speed by 3 stepsKnob 2: Four positions- Pump & swing off, Pump on, Pump + Auto Swing On, Auto Swing On‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢AIR DIRECTION CONTROL‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢Vertical Blades: No auto swing, Manual adjustment, all blades move simultaneouslyHorizontal Blades: Auto swing, Knob control, All blades move simultaneouslySo in practice you can have air directed either up or down or front, with auto swing of vertical blades covering all zones as per manually set horizontal blades.‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢TIPS‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢1. Install cooler near window or door so that it can pump in some of fresh air from outside to have a control over humidity.2. Better if you can install it in balcony, facing window such that its 3 sides are able to suck in fresh air. Cover rest of window with cardboard or thermocole sheets for better insulation. It helps control humidity in room, as if it‚Äôs inside a closed room, it continuously adds moisture.3. Cross ventilation doubles the cooling effect. So if cooler on one corner, provide air escape route on other corner.3. Use ice cool water for faster cooling. You can manually add ice to it.4. Clean cooler once or twice a week. It ensures long life of cooler and hygiene too. Or it may soon become prominent breeding place for mosquitoes.5. Do have an eye on air quality. If theres lot of water droplets along with air, get it checked or it may cost you coolers motor in long run, as it may burn.6. END OF SEASON TIP: To ensure long life of cooler, completely clean and dry it before storage. Then add few drops of oil to shaft of motor and store it. This way your cooler will be ready to cool upon unpack from last season or else you may end up your cooler in repair shop.‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢FINAL VERDICT‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚ñ∂Not a bad deal for the price and performance.

¬†Bajaj PX 97 Torque New 36L Personal Air CoolerThis is my first ever air cooler purchase. I have purchased this for my weekend home so investing 35000 rupees on an air conditioner didn‚Äôt make sense. I bought this Bajaj air cooler after a lot of online research and watched many YouTube videos and read many user reviews on many e-commerce websites.I can now say after using this cooler that it‚Äôs the best you can get in this budget.1- the air throw is very good2- mine is the new 2022 model in this variant, the build quality in this particular one is very good. The speed and pump/swing knobs are of good quality3- water level can be measured easily and the drain plug provided is useful4- the castor wheels are very smooth and easy to move around with full water tank5- the sound on top speed is not much, my window AC is my other house makes more sound than this. When the pump is on trickling of water can be heard6- honeycomb pads in the three sides are thick and it is easy to unscrew the three grills for cleaning purposes as the company has provided thumb screws7- the cooling is very good. Cools my 10x15 room in the afternoon very well when the outside temperature is 42 degrees8- there is smell when you turn it on the first time. The smell is because of the plastic and the fan motor inside. My recommendation is to keep the cooler running for 30-40 mins when you first turn it on. The smell will eventually go away and keep the cooler in a ventilated area for the first time when you switch onOverall I am happy and satisfied with my purchase and recommend other too if they plan to buy a budget friendly yet powerful air cooler.",New Model
23,27 May 2022,Stopped working after just a month. Pathetic Bajaj customer service,3.0,"After checking the reviews of all the popular coolers, decided to go for this one as it seemed the best at reasonable price. And supposedly Indian brand and product.Bad decision - just suddenly stopped working after a month (I don't know if they are sending sub standard quality products for Amazon orders or they are all of this quality or it's just our bad luck).Called Bajaj customer care, the technician came after a day (till then their support was good), said motor is gone and will be replaced as it's within the warranty period. And that it would take 2-3 days due the new motor to come.It's more than 2 weeks now, no sign of the person, no calls by him either nor follow up by the CS team even the next day after the technician's visit or even to update.I called them 3 days ago, they again said someone will call, and the standard response Sorry for the inconvenience caused... but noone has called or visited.They CS app just says on my service ticket that ""Request is pending due to spare parts availability"". That's it. Nothing about when it's expected or anything at all.No exchange also possible since it's more than a month now.Very sad and disappointed at this apathetic attitude and behaviour of the support staff, and product quality.----Update:The technician called, saying the motor has reached them. New motor has been installed and hopefully (touch wood) shouldn't have trouble again. If it does, will update here and probably never ever will buy another Bajaj product again.Also please note, these are all Chinese products / spare parts assembled here in India by all the major brands, not just Bajaj.",New Model

31,6 April 2021,great cooler at this price point,4.0,"pros :1. well suited for a small room of 12x12. i think even it can perform good in bigger rooms as well.2. air throw is good and sufficient.. u need to place the cooler in the corner where there is an open window or door and sit/sleep in opposite corner and u'll get a feeling of cool breeze even without adding water.. if water is added, it'll give great cooling effect.. can manage a hot summer afternoon with this..3. noise level is comparitively lower when compared to an air cooler with blower technology.. i always run it at the lowest speed and this is quite sufficient..4. weight is also managable and can easily be moved around as per convenience..5. honeycomb pads are of good quality and easy to maintain.. my previous cooler had honeycomb n still its running fine even after 8 years..cons :1. build quality is not up to the mark.. as such seen, it looks fine.. but once u lift it up or remove the panels, it feels flimsy.. in case it falls or takes a hit, u may need a service..2. water inlet space is at the back side and very narrow.. even if u pour water carefully, it spills.. also there is no ice chamber.. need to fill chilled water if u need coolest air flow.. but for me normal water suffice..3. the swing function doest work as expected.. it has very less travel and mostly it'll concentrate the air flow in a limited space.. the up and down action is also stiff..note : don't sit directly in front of cooler and enjoy the breeze, u'll definitely catch a cold if exposed for a prolonged time.. keep it at a distance and turn on the swing mode so that the air gets distributed and doesn't direct at u for a continous period.. rest use it appropriatley and sensibly and it'll not disappoint..",Old Model
32,10 March 2023,I feel chilled,5.0,Cooling is good enough. But cooling depends up on how cold your water is and how good is your ventilation in the room. Overall a good buy at this price range.,New Model

35,25 March 2022,Decent machine,3.0,"Machine got delivered within two days. Following observations made during one day of operation.1. Noise Level - It is better than expected. Low noise and doesn't feel uncomfortable.2. Water tank level glass - Water tank has much more capacity than indicted in front panel, I expect the vendor to show full to nil level. If you will fill wrt front level indicator, high probability that it will get emptied before morning. And pump will get damaged3. Provision for water filling feels very uncomfortable for filling 35 ltrs of water.4. No ice box provision like other coolers - Although I knew this before ordering, I think it should be included at this price range. I had no other option therefore ordered this machine.5. Good for one bed - It is okay only for 70 to 80 sq. ft area. Anything larger than that mostly will be unsatisfied.6. Doesn't look very strong - All the plastic looks very cheap. And all the knobs are very weak.7. Overall it's not that great for 6.5k. 4k would be a better price.",New Model

It doesn‚Äôt cool the entire 170 sqft living room. However, the cool air it throws rescues from the heat. You just have to be in the coverage area.3. The initial unpleasant odour goes off after a few hrs of use.4. Noise level is not that high. More or less similar to the ceiling fan. So isn‚Äôt a problem.5. The size is compact. Can be easily dragged anywhere. Without water you can easily lift it.For any one it may help, I‚Äôm using it in Chennai in peak summer.

51,11 April 2022,Average product,4.0,"Looking very good. Cooling is average. If you pour ice water then you get better cooling. The only problem is have to open any side of the cooler to fill water easily, which is a small task . Because you need good nails to get it removed. There is a small opening at back side through which you can pour water using mug or plastic bottle, still its a tedious process.In the first two days a foul smell of plastic was there, but it gone later.

(I had seen this in my cooler tank)4) check the buttons properly to have a deep clean. Don't show your muscles üòâ while handling it.5) if your room is closed and you want to use cooler - you can use both fan+water shower. Use water shower only for half of entire use. If possible keep your door/windows open for 1hour to have good cooling.6) it requires circulating air for better cooling7) if voltage issue is their, you will fill like  you are in a flight because it sounds very loud.8) it consumes almost same electricity which a common table fan uses.Overall good product and i am satisfied with its performance and quality.

56,1 September 2022,My review on cooler,3.0,"The cooler did an amazing job for the first 2-3 months. Cooling effect was very well felt. Idk what happened after 4 months, it was just the air being blown and less of cooling effect.Portability is a plus and feeding water is a mess since the inlet is too small.",New Model
57,31 March 2018,Its an air cooler and its perfect.,5.0,"First things first. This is Air Cooler and not Air Conditioner. Therefore, one should keep expectations accordingly.This works as good as any air cooler should work.1. Any air cooler works on the principle of blowing the air through a curtain of water, due to which the air is cooled.2. Since the air is passed though the curtain of water (pads which are being showered with water consistently), the air being blown carries a good amount of water in it. Therefore there needs to be a cross ventilation in room to let the air out. If not, then the room will be filled with water laden air and thus humidity will increase.3. Cross ventilation helps in achieving proper cooling effect of any air cooler. And, the above is the reason for Air Coolers not being efficient in areas near to sea-shore.4. The fan-type air cooler makes less noise than blower-type one. Also, the air deflection larger in comparison to blower-type.5. Clean the water tank on weekly basis.6. If your water supply is from bore-well or if you are living in hard water area, use vinegar to clean the water tank. Put vinegar in water till the pump is submerged and then just keep the pump running for 15-20 minutes. This will wash off the salt sediments from the cooling pads.7. The height of the cooler is perfect as expected. Well, the size of the cooler is well mentioned under the product description. Before buying, one can always get a proper idea of the size of the cooler. If not, then rush to nearest store and see with your own eyes for better judgement.8. 36 liters of water tank is more than sufficient. Its always better to fill the cooler daily with fresh water. Some people are complaining about water inlet being very small. It is not small. You can either put water through any bottle or you can put a pipe to fill water, both are convenient. I use big mouthed bottle.9. Only thing is that a mosquito net could have been accommodated on the panel of cooling pads. It's not a big deal though, because cooler is going to be used indoor.10. I have Symphony 8T cooler and this Bajaj Platini PX97, and this cooler makes less, much less noise.The cooler came in perfect condition and there was no damage. Even if one receives a cooler with damage, it can always be exchanged for new one under Amazon's exchange policy. Overall, I am satisfied with this cooler.",Old Model

62,8 May 2021,Value for money no damage best delivery,4.0,Real Review from a genuine customerDont compare with ACBest personal air Cooler due to pros and cons.ProsDecreases 3-5 degrees from outside temperaturecooling is same as all other cooler worksGood quality buildAll basic features with gud swingGood air throw with low noiseMovableHigh capacity 36 liter in personal air coolers (2 day usage)Removable side door for cleaning and draining old waterBest for office personal usageRun on inverterConsNo remoteShort in height difficult for people who sleep in bedWill not show much effect in humid areas such as costal areas and river side areas.Water input is only in backside no ice chamberFor best cooling effectFirst use only pump don't on air flow for 5 minutes. Means water running through cooling pad  before starting air throw.Give good space backside the cooler. Best you use near door or window and it should be open.Use cold water or ice or dip a mud clay pot.Use medium or low speed only for better cooling as the air passes slowly from water.Keep the cooler near to you maximum 2 meters,Old Model

64,29 May 2020,Avg product overall,3.0,"Been using this cooler for about a week. This is my 2nd cooler so thought of buying a small one. Currently its 40-42 deg outside and within that environment it does OK cooling. Though, I don't expect the cooling at this price point and size which a desert cooler does. Also, I have a concern with the knobs longevity, though I believe that will be present with all such coolers having knobs to adjust cooling setting. As advised it is a personal cooler where only 1 person can use it (2 person barely if you restrict your body movement to have the cool wind from the cooler).Pros - Small in size, easily portable, honeycomb meshCons - 1. Build quality - Plastic body, some of the side panels are not properly plugged and have a tendency to come out while moving it while fully loaded water.2. Position of wire is at a side of the cooler which quite reduces the way you position your cooler. If it was on the back side of the cooler, then it would have been better.3. By far the most irritating thing is the size of water inlet, which is a fixed position and quite small. They could have made it retractable. Its quite frustrating if you use bucket to fill the water. I advise to use a small hose to fill the water.Overall avg cooler I would say.",Old Model

70,23 April 2021,"""Honest Review"" ( Must read before buying )",4.0,"""Honest Review""I am giving this review after 20 days of use .. This is an amazing cooler in this price range...Pros :-1.) Can easily cool a small room2.) Can make you feel like an noisy AC if the surrounding temperature is around 37-38¬∞C3.) Good for summers4.) Must buy product5.) Very less price as compared to those of other companies like symphony and all but quality is same as that of other companies...Cons :-1.) NoisySo overall this is an excellent item in this price range..Except being noisy their are no cons. of it.. It's quite obvious that all coolers make some noise unlike ACs so , in fact , this is not a cons. either..So I strongly recommend those who are thinking to buy a new cooler and have many questions in mind ( like Should we buy this ? , Will the quality be good in low price range ? , Will it be worth buying ? Etc. Etc. ) that you should buy this cooler without a second thought .. This product is worth buying....",Old Model

Budget friendly2. Good capacity of water.3. Low power consumption4. Good cooling for single room.5. 3 side air inlet with honeycomb mesh.Cons :1. Plastic material could be better, but given its cost, its acceptable.2. Knobs for honeycomb filters are quite bad, they dont rotate easily and are too small to apply much force by bare hands. You might have to use pliers at times. That could be better.3. No ice tray.4. Water inlet if very small and inconvenient. So either you have to use pipe or small jug to slowly pour the water.5. Sometimes water distribution on honeycomb is not proper. Some areas stay dry even when cooler has been running for more than an hour.Overall a good buy for couples/bachelors/single room.",Old Model
74,8 April 2022,"Cooling is good, Provided you have proper ventilation.",4.0,Cooling is good better than coolers which come with blowers in the same price range. What I have observed is if you space where the coolers walls are not blocked and has proper space for air intake than the cooling is good and Fans cool much better than blowers.

86,21 May 2019,Best in the segment,5.0,I m sharing my experience after using it for one day.# Personel coolerCooler is well for a small room as well as it  is a personel cooler# best in the segmentU cant get better than this in this price segment i got it for 5k only. If it is in 5500 then its worth buying. I saw other brands but they r costly than this.# Good tank capacityIt has a decent tank capacity. U dont need to fill water again & again in a day. It lasts more than a day in regular usage. As it has honeycomb pads its usage of water is lesser.# Noise is okBetter than others as i have a symphony siesta 70 cooler. That one is for bigger room this one is for my small room. Makes so less noise in which u can sleep well without any prb.# MaintenanceHighly recommend for you if u always wants your cooler to be clean. Easily cleanable & opening the back panel is so easy. I love that. No screws no time wasting. Love that.# CoolingDecent cooling. Can say ok not for 3 or more but sufficient for 2 persons or small room. Gives cool air after a while. Firstly smells badly coz of new pads but after sometime u will not feel any smell just cool & fresh air.The power cord is of very good quality. Not just 2 pin adapter it has 3 pin which is quite better.Overall its a fair deal for price range 5k to 6k.Some Cons as i observed--# filling water- The hole is too small.# Height- even its wheels r too good easily movable but u need to add a trolly to use it for bed.# fan speed- not much difference between speed 1 2 3. It should be just low or high. Then it can make a difference.# Quality- plastic quality is good but it can be better.Thanks for reading. If u want a personal cooler then surely u will be happy after using it at this price point.Editing after a month it's going well.,Old Model

Do you want a cooler which works like a heater??,1.0,"Guys I am a guy who is like you same middle class and can not afford a AC so looking for a cooler which can cool my room in this Indian summer ranging from 40C to 50C. First ask yourself a simple question ""Would you pay 6000rs for a cooler which only throws normal air like -2C or -3C less"". After searching a lot on web,youtube and quora, I decided to order this cooler which is non-refundable taking a big risk and not listening to my papa. I thought same like you that maybe those who are complaining about this product that it is not cooling their room might be not aware about ventilation. Trust me guys I have a ventilation fan in my room and I have installed this cooler at the windows but still it throws hot air. I regretted a lot and my papa said that this type of cooler will easy be available in market at much lower price.Observations I made:-1.)Air throw rate is very low and this cooler have a very small fan installed in it's motor.2.)It do not throw cool air, totally useless3.)Body build is good but what you will do of it if it do not throw cool air, would you pay 6000 for a big piece of plastic box to keep it for decoration.Overall:- As I have wasted my money totally on this, I do not want other people to suffer like me so please  listen my advice and buy a big cooler at this price easily available at this price range in market.",New Model

152,7 March 2021,$$ Best Cooler under Budget $$,5.0,Got this for INR 5600/-Have been using this for a week. Genuine review. Before this i had Symphony Tower ( which was actually made for just one person)Here are my feedback on Bajaj Cooler- Excellent Fan Speed and Cooling for a small or medium room (150-250sq). Most cooller in this range do have small mouth from where Air is blown but this has big gateway and this actually makes a difference. More cooling.-Minimum Energy but Maximum Power- Large water Tank 36ltr. I actually have started filling 50% water as it is enough for whole night. Filling 100% water n rolling coolers is never recommended as it is bad for roller and can even damage it.- Body is made of plastic. U may get smell initially but that's common so don't get worried.. It happens with all cooler.- No seperate department for Ice chamber. But u can add cold water in tanker so not a big deal believe me.- Water level indicator is presentFor now no problem faced at all.. Everyone is happy with the purchase. Use it with proper ventilation for better result. Enjoy cooling.,Old Model

The overall equipment would cost just 2000 and worst case with some profit it is ok to pay Max Rs:3000. It doesn't even cool the space and you need to stand next to it to feel some change. The design is not perfect, For refilling water only trained and patient people will be able to do otherwise you will spill water in your room than filling the cooler, Once you filled the water in the tank then there is no way to drain that out and if you are not using the cooler during winter season then mosquitos would use that as breeding pool.Lot of (Water spilling and fan sound) noise during night and you won't be able to sleep. I have just used for 3 days and kept it aside in the room due to it's inefficiency.Best Advice for people looking for silent and cool air is to go for Air conditioner and don't waste your money in these coolers.Cooling pads are made in paper, if there are children's at home they will easily peel them out and if you simply touch the pads they are damaged (worst design)",Old Model

Seprare switch for cooler fan and pump. So that you can switch on/off pump as per your need.4. No remote.5. No need for power plug. You can plug it in normal switch board.,Old Model

And I am using it in the hot and humid weather of Kolkata. One trick to use it in humid conditions is to buy a dehumidifier. There are multiple dehumidifier available on Amazon with 1000 and that will absorb all the humidity. So just by spending 6-7K, you can save a lot of money which you would have otherwise spent on AC plus you can save your electricity bill. Hope this helps. Happy Summer üòä",New Model

233,19 July 2021,Doesn't meet expectations,2.0,"Water pouring inlet is very small.The cooling was good but the pump stopped working very soon in just few days after buying. Finding another pump to replace or someone to fix it within warranty.. not sure if I'll find. I'll update the review again if I get it fixed.The cooling pads are fixed on the sides on plastic surfaces which can be removed to clean the inside. That's not fixed very well and it is a huge task to remove on some sides and it doesn't fit 100% as it should after removing once. Would have been great if at least the sides sat better.This is meant to be portable. But the manual says, we can't move it to different rooms once water has been filled in the tank. It should have been taken care of in the design itself.Now we're just using it as a fan without the cooling pump.I wouldn't recommend this unless these points are fixed.Overall not a sturdy product.

Huge water tank capacity for full night usage4. Less power consumption 100Kw (Fan : 75Kw), So no need to bother about current bill. U can use the cooler whole day and night as a substitute for fan.Cons:1. No remote: Believe me, U tend to switch off cooler in mid night due to chilling effect. So U need to wake up, as remote not available.Either U can use extension switch in ur reach for switching off during night time.2. Dust formation :Dust is visible on Honeycomb pads and front frames after 15 days of usage. Cleaning is little bit difficult.3. No Ice cube chamber: There is no option for ice cubes. But U may not need it as well. The back side entry point for water is too small for filling ice cubes. U need thin ice cube frames to fill4.

Then you need to open it up and clean the inlet. The inlet to the tank is very small and pouring water in without spillage is difficult, and i had to get a hose to make it hassle free.

Exactly when the 1 year warranty was about to be over, the water circulating pump stopped working. As the complaint was lodged just before one day of the completion of the one year, the service centre (RS Service Centre, Hyderabad) replaced the same. Already the cooler fan was running slow and that was also informed to the visiting technician. Without checking, we were assured the fan was fine. Within 15 days of warranty completion and the technician's visit, the fan also stopped working. Now the service centre is demanding service and repairing charges to repair the same though we informed the visiting technician of the fan problem within the warranty period. I have a 8 month old baby and one cardiac patient in my home. Practically the so called branded Bajaj product didn't even last for a year and that's why I feel their customer service and product both are not worth of any stars.

The actual product is slightly small and that is good as it can fit any medium size room. The whole body is plastic.It is decent but need to check how it performs after 1 or 2 years. Though the top portion of the cooler is shaking in my product.The fan has a plastic blade and pump is small.The noise less may be due to plastic blades. The fan does not throw air more than 10 feet ( website claims :Powerful air throw 30-feet)You need to ensure that there is sufficient cross ventilation else the room will become stuffy.Overall a decent cooler if you are keeping it in your bedroom and sleeping near it.,Old Model

465,3 June 2021,Poor Quality,2.0,Started facing problem with its Fan in near about 1.5 months of usage.Service rep.of Bajaj says that he'll replace fan motor.Buyed it because the fan motor is manufactured by bajaj but it turned out to be of a low quality.Either the fan does does runs at all or runs slow if it starts.Wonder what will happen once the product completes warranty period.Motor's replacement or repair cost will go from my pocket.Besides that plastic body is of low quality.One thing positive in this cooler is good air throw but you can enjoy it only if fan motor works.Such an inferior quality of product is not expected from Bajaj.I regret selecting this cooler.,Old Model

584,19 May 2018,as a room cooler this product is excellent. Timely delivery by amazon,5.0,"So, as a room cooler this product is excellent. Timely delivery by amazon. However, it has its pros and cons just like every product.Pro's:1. Air flow, throw and swing are excellent.2. Pretty cool air delivered if tank is full.3. Doesn't take too much of space.4. Sleek design, a beautiful piece for your room unlike the local made coolers.5. Overall performance is superb.6. Pretty cheap than other coolers of this capacity (Others brands like Symphony, Usha etc won't give you a 36 litre cooler for 5-5.5K)I bought mines for 5.5K, performance is far better than other coolers.Con's:1. Water inlet is too small.2. Air flow is only sideways, not up and down.3. For the areas with hard water, keep adding a little quantity of vinegar to the water periodically or else salts will start to be deposited in the pump.4. you cant put ice cubes in it but yes you can put smaller ice cubes or crushed Ice.And who says there isn't a water outlet in it. THERE IS, JUST TAKE A LOOK BELOW THE TANK. YOU'LL FIND A BLACK RUBBER PIECE. Wake up folks, it Bajaj, they don't like to make things visible just like others.",Old Model

It works very well in small 8X12 heated room above 35 degree. It throws chilled air at a distance of 10 feet very strongly. Though I don't use swing fan but I have tested and it covers almost 150 degree. In the moderate heat of 35 degree, I have to switch it off after 10 mins as it becomes very cold, hence I am sure it will work very well in scorching heat.",Old Model

594,24 May 2019,Detailed review for this cooler,5.0,"Purchased this after a month long research on which cooler to buy. Even visiting retail shops to compare with other coolers with this one.As per my usage, it takes upto 12 hours of continuous use for the water to dry up.Rule of thumb while buying a cooler is to remember that:1. This is not an AC. This is a water based cooling system.2. If your room is shut and windows are closed, the room will get really humid. Because, science. So for optimum performance, keep the room open and we'll ventilated. The 3 intake grills should be free of any obstructions.3. WILL NOT WORK AS IT HAS TO IF THE CLIMATE IS HUMID.The cooler does a wonderful job in cooling the room down to 26¬∞C on a dry summer day.The only con is, sometimes it gives out a wet cloth smell. This is because of the honeycomb mesh. But, that's okay, it will go away after a while.",Old Model
595,28 March 2021,Little noisy. But good design,4.0,Quite noisy and it is very difficult to pour water without spilling on the floor. Quite difficult to understand the buttons. Which position means cool with water which means just fan not very clear. Else it seems to work fine.,Old Model
596,24 April 2021,Worth of money,4.0,"This product is very good within the price range. But it would have been better, if the water pouring port would have been little bigger and extended more outside. Due to the small size of that spillage may happen.",Old Model
597,24 April 2022,"Nice Product, Value for Money",5.0,Overall experience of using this cooler is Very Good. Cross ventilation will help cooling experience much better.Only drawback is arrangement for adding water is too small. Using hose pipe the only better option. Adding water by mugs is very time consuming and irritating task.Company should make water inlet opening bigger.,New Model
598,18 June 2020,Nice coller for 1 to 3 person,4.0,It works nice when the room ventilation is good. Can use fan and water motor mood. Very easy easy to open but difficult to clean water chamber.

It kept my room cool in peak of summer. The only problem is draining water out of the tub at the end of the summer season. I was using the fan all through  without running the pump after summer. I like its size and look. An excellent personal cooler. The only con is that it is a bit highly priced.,Old Model
602,22 March 2021,Good to buy,4.0,"Excellent product, handy and economical. Only problem is the throw of air is not more than 15 to 20 feet so not recommended for medium room or hall. Also it is only usable for 2 persons.",Old Model

616,25 April 2019,Not quite what I was looking for.,1.0,"It doesn't match any criteria for what I needed in a cooler and what I was expecting.My room comes within the area of 150 sq. Feet and as per the cooler description ,it should have worked very fine and smoothly.But no sir , not at all.The air throwing capacity is much lesser. Speed control button does not work the way you want to ,meaning all three Speed settings have same speed .It worked fine when bought for 10 days max. Because at that time the temperature was 30¬∞c average.And as the daily temperature started to rise daily avg. of 40¬∞c this doesn't work at all.I had to buy a fan ,not Bajaj (never Bajaj again).So if you want to buy a cooler just purchase through a local dealer and if daily temperature rises upto 42-43¬∞c then try to purchase big cooler with blower of any local company. I think this cooler is only for room decoration.It seems like they bragged too much about what this cooler can do . And that is nothing at all.If I can return it then I would in a heartbeat not expecting full refund either . Just enough so that I can buy another cooler.P.S.:-I hope those who want to buy it think for a moment.My expectations are very low at this moment.",Old Model

749,28 June 2020,Just ok. If you can't afford air conditioner,3.0,"Honestly I won't say it's too good. It's good if your temperature level is below 40. And yes atleast it is better than fan . Above 40 degrees,I think you need to pour cold water so as to get releif. Normal water works.onkg when temp is below 39 -38",Old Model
750,13 June 2020,Cheap quality finish.,3.0,Controls not clear. No instruction manual on how to clean the water tank. Very flimsy and cheap shell. Using it for a few weeks now and not able to clean the water tank. Tried to open the cover but the plastic screws don‚Äôt even turn. Water inlet is very inconvenient!!!,Old Model
751,17 June 2020,Does the job but very flimsy,4.0,"Air flow is good. Takes in almost 2 buckets of water that lasts a day. Makes very less noise. Only concern is the body is not very strong. Need to handle with care. ***Please allow cross ventilation i.e one opening behind, one ahead",Old Model
752,25 April 2021,Very good product,4.0,It is a good product it does noise less and it makes room cool faster and good water capacity. It is perfect as a personal cooler,Old Model

755,31 March 2018,Sound of the water droplets falling from honeycomb is really worst,2.0,"I bought it for 5674 INR. Lookswise it is good. Small and cute. Performance wise also, it gives good amount of coolness if you sit just straight to the fan. It doesn't cool remaining room as it is not a split AC. The sounds of motor and fan are very low. But the sound of water falling from the honeycomb inside to the tank is really something which is very irritating. The plastic used is of really very very cheap quality. Other than plastic quality and the water droplets continuous sound, it does its work perfectly.Edit : Forgot to mention, intially you might get a worst possible smell from your cooler if you use cooling option by pouring water in it. Need not to worry. Just take 2 or 3 naphthalene balls, powder them and mix it in the water. I got rid of the smell immediately after doing this. So thought of sharing if it might be useful. Thank you.",Old Model

999,11 April 2017,A good cooler!,5.0,"Lovely product. Was confused between symphony and this one, but went ahead with this one due to its higher capacity at comparable price. Also, weird reviews about symphony service was a major turn off. Cools down well. Ofcourse not comparable to an A.C. but does the job if you're right in front of it. Although I would admit, local desert coolers are much more effective, this one has its own pros such as portability, non-rust-able body, and most importantly, runs on low power(inverter compatible). The only con is - it doesn't have a drain plug, which could haunt me later when perhaps the clogged water could start stinking. But till that time arrives - its 5 stars for me!",Old Model

3934,15 July 2018,Decent cooler if you know how to use it effectively,4.0,"I have been using the Bajaj cooler for 2 monthsand hence posting the reviewPros:-1)Compact and portable2) Easy mobility with the help of  castor wheels3)It gives out nice cool breeze with the water filled inCons:1) the plastic screws can be replaced with metal ones2) the plastic body joints sometimes leaves little gaps so bajaj should think of making better bodiesI have some recommendations for those who are thinking buying this cooler or any cooler1) Always measure your room dimensions first before buying a coolerFor example if you expect  this cooler to cool a room of 300 square feet it wont happenbut if its meant for a room 150 sq feet and below it will serve the purpose2) this cooler doesn't comes with humidity control so what's the best way to control humidity ?whenever you run the cooler and after the pump/cooling is tuned on after sometime you will feel that the cooler is not cooling  that much that it was at the beginning when you started the pump ,the reason is the humidity level of the room is saturated.. so solution for this is turn off the pump and use the cooler fan only for some time and you get cooling again .. again after some time when you feel hot you need to turn on the pump..This is how humidity control works 3) Get a extension power cord which will cost you few hundreds which will help you to move the cooler to any part of the room4)Get a  water filling pipe which you can use to fill water from the back side as filling water with bottles or mug is not recommended as it will spill water on floor5)And you have to manually move the louvers or grill up or down to get air on top or at floor level6) Always keep some windows open to allow cross ventilation in roomOverall this is a decent cooler if you know how to use a cooler
